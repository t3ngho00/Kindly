# Project: Resonance Radio
> A voice-AI companion disguised as a familiar radio, designed to combat loneliness and support the independence of older adults living at home.

## 🎯 Overview
"Resonance Radio" addresses the growing problem of loneliness, reduced physical activity, and digital exclusion among adults aged 65 and above. Our target users often live alone, have shrinking social circles, and find modern apps and screens confusing or alienating.

Our solution is a voice-first AI companion embedded within a familiar, non-intimidating object: a classic "radio." The user never interacts with a screen; they simply talk to their radio. The device plays era-appropriate music, shares memories, and uses these moments as a gentle bridge to prompt movement, connect with family, and engage with the local community.

## 💔 The Problem: Core Pains
Our target users are struggling with:
* **Loneliness:** A lack of meaningful, consistent conversation in their daily life.
* **Loss of Routine:** Reduced motivation to move, go out, or maintain daily habits.
* **Technology Alienation:** Feeling "left behind" and confused by new technology, apps, and menus.
* **Community Disconnection:** A weakening connection to local services, hobbies, and events.

## 💡 The Solution: A Familiar Bridge
We provide a companion that feels safe, respectful, and familiar. By adopting the form of a classic radio, we eliminate the friction of screens and menus.

* **Voice-Only Interaction:** The user just talks to "the radio."
* **Nostalgia-Driven Engagement:** Uses era-appropriate music, news clips, and jingles to build rapport and spark positive memories.
* **Gentle Nudging:** Uses moments of nostalgia to gently prompt light physical movement, personal reflection, and social contact.
* **Simple Connections:** Connects to a simple back-end for receiving family messages, hearing local event info, and supporting daily routines.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy & Goals

### Our Goals
1.  **Reduce Loneliness:** Offer warm, human-like conversation and, most importantly, provide prompts to connect with real people (family, neighbours, local groups).
2.  **Support Independence:** Help users maintain simple daily routines, including medication reminders, appointments, and hydration.
3.  **Encourage Physical Activity:** Use short, voice-guided "movement moments" synced with music they love.
4.  **Maintain Identity & Dignity:** Respect the user's preferences, use content from their own generation, and never be patronizing.

### What We Are **Not**
This AI is a **"bridge" back to the world, not a destination** in itself.
* **We do not replace humans:** The AI's primary goal is to *increase* contact with family, friends, and caregivers, not act as a substitute.
* **We are not a medical device:** We do not provide medical diagnoses, emergency response, or clinical therapy.
* **We are not a smart speaker:** This is a highly focused tool for aging, social connection, and community participation, not a general-purpose assistant.

## ✨ Value Proposition

* **For Older Adults:** A safe, non-technical, and respectful everyday companion. It fits naturally into their home and brings moments of joy, movement, and connection sparked by the music of their youth.
* **For Families & Caregivers:** Peace of mind through light-touch, optional logs (e.g., activity, engagement, routine adherence). It provides an easy way to send voice messages or reminders.
* **For Society & Service Providers:** A low-friction channel to keep older adults engaged with community events, local activities, and preventative wellbeing programs.

## 📻 How It Works: The "Radio" Experience
The companion operates like an old-fashioned radio station, with a predictable daily schedule of "programs" designed to support the user's wellbeing.

### 1. The Morning Wake-Up Show
* **What it is:** A gentle start to the day.
* **Example:** "Good morning, shall we start with your song for today?"
* **Function:** Plays a familiar track from their youth, then gives a simple recap of the day (e.g., today’s appointments, pill reminders, a planned walk).

### 2. The "Movement Minute"
* **What it is:** A short, guided exercise broadcast tied to a routine.
* **Example:** "And now, a short movement break with your favourite music."
* **Function:** Prompts light, seated stretches, gentle steps by the chair, or arm movements, always framed as a light radio program.

### 3. The "Memory Lane" Program
* **What it is:** A nostalgia-based conversation starter.
* **Example:** Plays an old jingle. "Do you remember where you were when you used to hear this? ... Let me know your thoughts."
* **Function:** Uses a song or audio clip to spark reflection. If the user responds, the AI engages. It can optionally record a voice note of the memory to share with family.

### 4. The Community & News Bulletin
* **What it is:** A simple, accessible bulletin of local info and light news.
* **Example:** "There is a coffee club on Thursday nearby. Would you like me to remind you or tell your daughter?"
* **Function:** Delivers light news, weather, and information on local senior activities, prompting real-world participation.

### 5. The Evening Reflection Show
* **What it is:** A calm end to the day.
* **Example:** "The day is almost over. Do you have anything you'd like to share? ... How was your day?"
* **Function:** Asks for a simple reflection (e.g., "best moment") and can offer to pass a short voice message to family, fostering connection.

## ⚙️ Core Logic
The system runs on a simple, adaptive loop:

1.  **Sense:** Listens for the user’s voice, detects engagement level, and basic emotional tone.
2.  **Recall:** Uses the user's profile (age, language, culture, past preferences) and recent interactions.
3.  **Select:** Picks a suitable audio piece (music, memory, info) and a matching micro-intervention (a movement prompt, reflection question, or social nudge).
4.  **Act:** Speaks and plays content through the radio, waits for a response, and adapts in real time.
5.  **Log & Learn:** Stores lightweight, privacy-aware interaction data (e.g., "liked song," "skipped exercise") to improve future suggestions and provide optional summaries to family or carers.
