# 🎙️ Senior Radio — Voice-Based AI Companion
*A nostalgic radio-like AI companion to support seniors in daily wellbeing.*

---

## 📚 Overview
**Senior Radio** is a voice-driven AI companion designed to feel like a familiar old radio.  
There are **no screens or apps**—users simply talk to the device.

The system guides seniors through daily routines, plays nostalgic content, encourages light movement, and reconnects them with family and local communities.

The companion cycles through predictable **daily “radio programs”**:

- **Morning Show** — greeting, nostalgic song, daily reminders  
- **Movement Minute** — short guided exercises  
- **Memory Lane** — music or stories with optional reflection  
- **Community & News** — simple local updates  
- **Evening Reflection** — day recap & optional message to family  

After each program:  
> “**Let me know your thoughts.**”

If the user responds, the AI engages. If not, it moves gently to the next program.
